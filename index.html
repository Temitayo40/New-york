        <h1><strong>By <a href="#" >Dennis Overbye</a></strong></h1>
        <p>March 17, 2014</p>
       </div>
     <div class="letters">
         <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
              with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, 
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
            <br>
         <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created 
             in the Big Bang. 
             Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed 
             course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force,
              causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
              <br>
         <P>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
             the Big Bang,
             and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</P>
             <br>
        <P>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the <a href="">first sliver of cosmic time </a>with telescopes at the South Pole, a team 
            of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric
             of space-time — so-called <a href="">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was
              roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
               inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</P>
              <br>
        <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
        <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe 
            apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
             <br>
        <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies,
            is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there
             might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
             <br>
        <h2>‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>
        
        <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth 
            and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according
          to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the 
            universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported
             their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
             <br>
        <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally
             delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry,
             who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go
           on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,<a href="">knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne 
           to tell him the news.</a></p>
        <br>

             </div>

        <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did 
            order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>

           <h2>Spirals in the Sky</h2>
        <P>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago.
             They won the Nobel Prize.</P>
        <br>
        <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at 
            the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of 
            Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever 
            since,” he said.</p>
        <br>
         <div class="telescope">
             <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/18/science/space/18cosmos-2/18cosmos-2-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp">
             <p>The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a universe being wrenched
                  violently apart at its birth.Credit...Steffen Richter/Associated Press</p>
         </div>
        <br>
        <P>In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate 
            in one direction rather than another.</P>
        <br>
        <P>This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching
             it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the
              sky should have little arrows going in spirals.</P>
        <br>
        <p>Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is 
            basically a giant superconducting thermometer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right
             and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.</p>
